    <h1>Test Article for Media Bias Analyzer</h1>
    
    <p>This is a test article to verify that the Media Bias Analyzer extension is working correctly with the new client-side prompt storage implementation.</p>
    
    <p>The article discusses a fictional political event where both conservative and liberal viewpoints are presented. This allows us to test the bias analysis functionality.</p>
    
    <p>Conservative politicians argue that lower taxes will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. They point to historical examples where tax cuts led to increased business investment.</p>
    
    <p>Liberal politicians counter that higher taxes on the wealthy are necessary to fund social programs and reduce inequality. They cite studies showing that trickle-down economics has not benefited the middle class.</p>
    
    <p>Both sides present their arguments with conviction, though some experts suggest a balanced approach might be more effective than either extreme position.</p>
    
    <p>The debate continues with no clear resolution, as is often the case in complex policy discussions.</p>
