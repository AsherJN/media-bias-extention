# Project Progress: Media Bias Analyzer

## Current Status

The Media Bias Analyzer is currently at version 2.0, with a functional Chrome extension that can analyze news articles for bias and present the results in a side panel interface. The project has evolved from a basic concept to a comprehensive tool with multiple analysis dimensions and a modern UI.

### Development Stage
- **Extension UI**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Backend API**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Content Extraction**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic implementation
- **History Feature**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Settings Feature**: ‚úÖ Client-side prompt storage and retrieval implemented
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive README with architecture, features, and roadmap
- **Deployment**: üöß Local development only

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- **Article Analysis**: Users can analyze any news article with a single click
- **Bias Detection**: The system evaluates media bias on a scale from -5 to +5
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Multiple dimensions of analysis are provided
- **Side Panel UI**: Results are displayed in a clean, modern interface

### User Interface
- **Bias Meter**: Visual representation of bias with gradient and arrow indicator
- **Expandable Sections**: Collapsible content areas for each analysis component
- **Loading Indicator**: Spinner shown during analysis processing
- **Progress Updates**: Text prompts fade in/out at key analysis milestones alongside the loading spinner
- **UI Spacing**: Consistent spacing between header and bias score div for improved visual alignment
- **Responsive Layout**: UI adapts to the side panel dimensions
- **Customizable Prompt Editor**: Separate editable fields for each prompt section, auto-save, reset-to-default, and placeholder preservation

### Data Management
- **History Tracking**: Previously analyzed articles are saved and can be revisited
- **Local Storage**: Analysis results persist between browser sessions
- **History Management**: Users can delete individual entries or clear all history
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and troubleshooting guides

### Backend Integration
- **Flask API**: Backend server processes analysis requests
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4o model performs the actual analysis
- **JSON Formatting**: Structured data exchange between components

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Tasks
- **Enhanced Text Extraction**: Improve article content extraction for various website structures
- **Settings Implementation**: Add user-configurable options
- **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export analysis results or history
- **Error Recovery**: Improve handling of network failures and API issues

### Medium-term Features
- **Backend Deployment**: Move from local-only to a hosted solution
- **User Accounts**: Optional accounts for syncing across devices
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Add emotional tone evaluation
- **Improved Visualization**: Enhanced data visualization for analysis results

### Long-term Enhancements
- **Historical Tracking**: Track bias patterns across publications over time
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest alternative sources
- **Cross-browser Support**: Expand beyond Chrome
- **Mobile Companion**: Create a mobile app version

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Content Extraction Limitations**: The current paragraph extraction method is basic and may miss content on some websites
2. **Local Backend Requirement**: Users must run a local server, limiting accessibility
3. **API Dependency**: Reliance on OpenAI API introduces potential points of failure
4. **Performance Variability**: Analysis time can vary based on API response time
5. **~~OpenAI Package Compatibility~~**: ~~The backend required an update from OpenAI package version 0.28.1 to 1.12.0 to resolve import compatibility issues~~ (Resolved)

### User Experience Issues
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires local server setup and API key
2. **Limited Settings**: Few user-configurable options currently available
3. **No Offline Mode**: Cannot function without internet connection
4. **Limited Feedback Mechanisms**: No way for users to report inaccurate analyses

### Business/Product Issues
1. **Cost Management**: OpenAI API usage incurs costs that need to be managed
2. **No Monetization**: No current revenue model to sustain development
3. **Limited Marketing**: No formal marketing or user acquisition strategy
4. **Competition**: Other media bias tools exist in the marketplace

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### UI Evolution
- **Initial Concept**: Started as a simple popup with basic bias score
- **Expanded Analysis**: Added multiple dimensions of analysis
- **Side Panel Migration**: Moved from popup to side panel for better user experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Implemented collapsible sections to manage information density

### Technical Evolution
- **Manifest V3**: Updated to latest Chrome extension manifest version
- **API Integration**: Moved from earlier GPT models to GPT-4o
- **Storage Strategy**: Implemented local storage with history management
- **Error Handling**: Improved robustness with better error handling

### Feature Prioritization
- **Core Analysis**: Initially focused on basic bias detection
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Expanded to include multiple analysis dimensions
- **History Tracking**: Added to enhance user experience and continuity
- **Settings Framework**: Laid groundwork for user customization

## Milestones and Achievements

### Version 1.0
- Basic Chrome extension with popup interface
- Simple bias analysis using earlier GPT models
- Basic text extraction from news articles

### Version 2.0 (Current)
- Side panel interface with modern design
- Comprehensive analysis with multiple dimensions
- History tracking and management
- Settings framework

- **Version 3.0**: User accounts and advanced analytics

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons
- Chrome's side panel API provides better UX for content-heavy extensions
- Balancing API usage with analysis depth is crucial for cost management
- Local storage is effective for history but has limitations for cross-device use

### Product Lessons
- Users value multiple dimensions of analysis beyond simple bias scores
- History feature enhances the perceived value of the tool
- Setup complexity is a barrier to adoption that needs addressing

### Process Lessons
- Iterative development with focused features works well for this project
- Documentation is essential for maintaining momentum
- Testing with diverse news sources reveals edge cases and improvement opportunities
