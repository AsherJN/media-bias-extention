- **Side Panel UI**: Results are displayed in a clean, modern interface

### User Interface
- **Bias Meter**: Visual representation of bias with gradient and arrow indicator
- **Expandable Sections**: Collapsible content areas for each analysis component
- **Loading Indicator**: Spinner shown during analysis processing
- **Progress Updates**: Text prompts fade in/out at key analysis milestones alongside the loading spinner
- **UI Spacing**: Consistent spacing between header and bias score div for improved visual alignment
- **Responsive Layout**: UI adapts to the side panel dimensions
- **Prompt Editor**: Comprehensive interface for customizing the AI prompt with separate sections for Personality and Dashboard Items

### Data Management
- **History Tracking**: Previously analyzed articles are saved and can be revisited
- **Local Storage**: Analysis results persist between browser sessions
- **History Management**: Users can delete individual entries or clear all history
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with installation, usage, and troubleshooting guides
- **JSON Prompt Framework**: Structured storage of prompt sections for improved maintainability and customization

### Backend Integration
- **Flask API**: Backend server processes analysis requests
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4o model performs the actual analysis
- **JSON Formatting**: Structured data exchange between components
- **Standardized JSON Structure**: Backend returns raw JSON with standardized field names

## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Tasks
- **Enhanced Text Extraction**: Improve article content extraction for various website structures
- **Settings Implementation**: Add user-configurable options
- **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export analysis results or history
- **Error Recovery**: Improve handling of network failures and API issues
- **Advanced Prompt Features**: Add ability to create and save custom prompt templates

### Medium-term Features
- **Backend Deployment**: Move from local-only to a hosted solution
- **User Accounts**: Optional accounts for syncing across devices
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Add emotional tone evaluation
- **Improved Visualization**: Enhanced data visualization for analysis results
- **Dashboard Customization**: Allow users to add, remove, or reorder dashboard items

### Long-term Enhancements
- **Historical Tracking**: Track bias patterns across publications over time
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest alternative sources
- **Cross-browser Support**: Expand beyond Chrome
- **Mobile Companion**: Create a mobile app version
- **Prompt Template Library**: Create a library of prompt templates for different types of analysis

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Content Extraction Limitations**: The current paragraph extraction method is basic and may miss content on some websites
2. **Local Backend Requirement**: Users must run a local server, limiting accessibility
3. **API Dependency**: Reliance on OpenAI API introduces potential points of failure
4. **Performance Variability**: Analysis time can vary based on API response time
5. **~~OpenAI Package Compatibility~~**: ~~The backend required an update from OpenAI package version 0.28.1 to 1.12.0 to resolve import compatibility issues~~ (Resolved)
6. **~~Dashboard Items Display~~**: ~~Dashboard_item_1 and dashboard_item_2 were not appearing on the frontend due to naming inconsistencies between backend and frontend~~ (Resolved)
7. **JSON Schema Evolution**: Need to handle schema changes in the prompt framework as new features are added
8. **~~Prompt Customization~~**: ~~Custom roles in prompts (like the Gen-Z middle schooler) not being properly applied by the AI model while maintaining JSON schema compliance~~ (Resolved with a two-part solution: 1) placing all instructions in the system message and only the article text in the user message, 2) using the OpenAI API's response_format parameter to enforce JSON structure while adding explicit instructions to maintain the role's personality within JSON fields)

### User Experience Issues
1. **Initial Setup Complexity**: Requires local server setup and API key
2. **Limited Settings**: Few user-configurable options currently available
3. **No Offline Mode**: Cannot function without internet connection
4. **Limited Feedback Mechanisms**: No way for users to report inaccurate analyses
5. **Prompt Template Management**: No way to save and manage multiple prompt templates

### Business/Product Issues
1. **Cost Management**: OpenAI API usage incurs costs that need to be managed
2. **No Monetization**: No current revenue model to sustain development
3. **Limited Marketing**: No formal marketing or user acquisition strategy
4. **Competition**: Other media bias tools exist in the marketplace

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### UI Evolution
- **Initial Concept**: Started as a simple popup with basic bias score
- **Expanded Analysis**: Added multiple dimensions of analysis
- **Side Panel Migration**: Moved from popup to side panel for better user experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Implemented collapsible sections to manage information density
- **Customization Interface**: Added interfaces for customizing the prompt

### Technical Evolution
- **Manifest V3**: Updated to latest Chrome extension manifest version
- **API Integration**: Moved from earlier GPT models to GPT-4o
- **Storage Strategy**: Implemented local storage with history management
- **Error Handling**: Improved robustness with better error handling
- **Prompt Architecture**: Evolved from string-based to JSON-based prompt structure
- **Code Standardization**: Removed all backward compatibility code for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase

### Feature Prioritization
- **Core Analysis**: Initially focused on basic bias detection
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Expanded to include multiple analysis dimensions
- **History Tracking**: Added to enhance user experience and continuity
- **Settings Framework**: Laid groundwork for user customization
- **Prompt Modularity**: Restructured prompt to enable more flexible customization
