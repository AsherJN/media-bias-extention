# Product Context: Media Bias Analyzer

## Problem Statement
In today's digital media landscape, news consumers face several challenges:

1. **Information Overload**: The sheer volume of news content makes it difficult to critically assess each article.
2. **Echo Chambers**: Social media algorithms and self-selection often expose users to content that reinforces existing beliefs.
3. **Hidden Bias**: Media bias can be subtle and difficult to detect without careful analysis.
4. **Lack of Context**: News articles often present information without sufficient historical or alternative context.
5. **Time Constraints**: Most readers don't have time to research multiple sources for every news story.
