# Project Brief: Media Bias Analyzer Chrome Extension

## Project Overview
The Media Bias Analyzer is a Chrome extension designed to provide users with comprehensive and nuanced analysis of online news articles. It leverages a Flask backend and the OpenAI GPT API to evaluate various aspects of an article, helping users understand the underlying bias, context, and framing of the news content they consume.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Article Analysis**: Extract and analyze text content from news articles on any website
2. **Bias Detection**: Evaluate media bias on a scale from -5 (left-leaning) to +5 (right-leaning)
3. **Comprehensive Insights**: Provide multiple dimensions of analysis including:
   - Analysis summary (subjective overview of bias)
   - Historical context
   - Content summary
   - Language tone analysis
   - Framing perspective
   - Alternative perspectives
   - Publisher bias information
4. **User Interface**: Present analysis results in a clean, modern side panel with expandable sections
5. **History Tracking**: Save and display user's previous article analyses
6. **Settings Management**: Allow users to configure extension preferences

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Analysis should complete within a reasonable timeframe
2. **Usability**: Interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate
3. **Reliability**: Extension should work consistently across different news websites
4. **Security**: Handle API keys securely and protect user data
5. **Maintainability**: Code should be well-structured and documented
