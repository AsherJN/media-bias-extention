Within your extension folder, create a new folder named icons.
For now, you can use placeholder images. You can create simple icons or download free ones.
Name the icons icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png corresponding to their sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels).
Place these images inside the icons folder.
